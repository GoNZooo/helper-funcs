To install/use the helper functions, download and place helper-funcs.el
in a directory of your choosing and in your .emacs file you add the following:

   (add-to-list 'load-path THAT_DIRECTORY)
   (require 'helper-funcs)

To use the auto-indent you call, for example, the following:

    (add-auto-indentation '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook python-mode-hook))

To add a file extension binding you can call the function:

    (add-auto-mode extension prog-mode)
    
for example:

    (add-auto-mode ".rkt" 'scheme-mode)

(Do note that the prog-mode is sent as a symbol, hence the ')
The file will auto start with that prog-mode when opened.
