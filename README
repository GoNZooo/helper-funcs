To install/use the helper functions, download and place helper-funcs.el
to a directory of your choosing and in your .emacs file you add the following:

   (add-to-list 'load-path THAT_DIRECTORY)
   (require 'helper-funcs)

If you want to use auto-indent for a prog mode you can edit the variable
called 'prog-mode-hooks' in the helper-funcs.el file and add the hook you want.
To use the auto-indent you call, for example, the following:

    (add-auto-indentation '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook python-mode-hook))

To add a file extension binding you can call the function:

    (add-auto-mode extension prog-mode)

The file will auto start with that prog-mode when opened.
